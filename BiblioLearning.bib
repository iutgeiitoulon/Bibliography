	abstract={Deep learning has recently become immensely popular for image recognition, as well as for other recognition and pattern matching tasks in, e.g., speech processing, natural language processing, and so forth. The online evaluation of deep neural networks, however, comes with significant computational complexity, making it, until recently, feasible only on power-hungry server platforms in the cloud. In recent years, we see an emerging trend toward embedded processing of deep learning networks in edge devices: mobiles, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) nodes. This would enable us to analyze data locally in real time, which is not only favorable in terms of latency but also mitigates privacy issues. Yet evaluating the powerful but large deep neural networks with power budgets in the milliwatt or even microwatt range requires a significant improvement in processing energy efficiency.},

In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning, and information theory.}

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.",

	abstract = { We show how to use “complementary priors” to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind. }
