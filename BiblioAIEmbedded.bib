	abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology for recognizing three fundamental movements of the human forearm (extension, flexion and rotation) using pattern recognition applied to the data from a single wrist-worn, inertial sensor. We propose that this technique could be used as a clinical tool to assess rehabilitation progress in neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke or cerebral palsy by tracking the number of times a patient performs specific arm movements (e.g. prescribed exercises) with their paretic arm throughout the day. We demonstrate this with healthy subjects and stroke patients in a simple proof of concept study in which these arm movements are detected during an archetypal activity of daily-living (ADL) – ‘making-a-cup-of-tea’. Data is collected from a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope located proximal to the wrist. In a training phase, movements are initially performed in a controlled environment which are represented by a ranked set of 30 time-domain features. Using a sequential forward selection technique, for each set of feature combinations three clusters are formed using k-means clustering followed by 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation on the training data to determine the best feature combinations. For the testing phase, movements performed during the ADL are associated with each cluster label using a minimum distance classifier in a multi-dimensional feature space, comprised of the best ranked features, using Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance as the metric. Experiments were performed with four healthy subjects and four stroke survivors and our results show that the proposed methodology can detect the three movements performed during the ADL with an overall average accuracy of 88% using the accelerometer data and 83% using the gyroscope data across all healthy subjects and arm movement types. The average accuracy across all stroke survivors was 70% using accelerometer data and 66% using gyroscope data. We also use a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in association with the same set of features to detect the three arm movements and compare the results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.}

	abstract = "A K-means clustering approach is proposed for the automated diagnosis of defective rolling element bearings. Since K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning procedure, the method can be directly implemented to measured vibration data. Thus, the need for training the method with data measured on the specific machine under defective bearing conditions is eliminated. This fact consists the major advantage of the method, especially in industrial environments. Critical to the success of the method is the feature set used, which consists of a set of appropriately selected frequency-domain parameters, extracted both from the raw signal, as well as from the signal envelope, as a result of the engineering expertise, gained from the understanding of the physical behavior of defective rolling element bearings. Other advantages of the method are its ease of programming, simplicity and robustness. In order to overcome the sensitivity of the method to the choice of the initial cluster centers, the initial centers are selected using features extracted from simulated signals, resulting from a well established model for the dynamic behavior of defective rolling element bearings. Then, the method is implemented as a two-stage procedure. At the first step, the method decides whether a bearing fault exists or not. At the second step, the type of the defect (e.g. inner or outer race) is identified. The effectiveness of the method is tested in one literature established laboratory test case and in three different industrial test cases. Each test case includes successive measurements from bearings under different types of defects. In all cases, the method presents a 100% classification success. Contrarily, a K-means clustering approach, which is based on typical statistical time domain based features, presents an unstable classification behavior."
