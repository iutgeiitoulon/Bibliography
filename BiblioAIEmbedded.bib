	abstract = {In this paper we present a methodology for recognizing three fundamental movements of the human forearm (extension, flexion and rotation) using pattern recognition applied to the data from a single wrist-worn, inertial sensor. We propose that this technique could be used as a clinical tool to assess rehabilitation progress in neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke or cerebral palsy by tracking the number of times a patient performs specific arm movements (e.g. prescribed exercises) with their paretic arm throughout the day. We demonstrate this with healthy subjects and stroke patients in a simple proof of concept study in which these arm movements are detected during an archetypal activity of daily-living (ADL) – ‘making-a-cup-of-tea’. Data is collected from a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope located proximal to the wrist. In a training phase, movements are initially performed in a controlled environment which are represented by a ranked set of 30 time-domain features. Using a sequential forward selection technique, for each set of feature combinations three clusters are formed using k-means clustering followed by 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation on the training data to determine the best feature combinations. For the testing phase, movements performed during the ADL are associated with each cluster label using a minimum distance classifier in a multi-dimensional feature space, comprised of the best ranked features, using Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance as the metric. Experiments were performed with four healthy subjects and four stroke survivors and our results show that the proposed methodology can detect the three movements performed during the ADL with an overall average accuracy of 88% using the accelerometer data and 83% using the gyroscope data across all healthy subjects and arm movement types. The average accuracy across all stroke survivors was 70% using accelerometer data and 66% using gyroscope data. We also use a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in association with the same set of features to detect the three arm movements and compare the results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.}

	abstract = "A K-means clustering approach is proposed for the automated diagnosis of defective rolling element bearings. Since K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning procedure, the method can be directly implemented to measured vibration data. Thus, the need for training the method with data measured on the specific machine under defective bearing conditions is eliminated. This fact consists the major advantage of the method, especially in industrial environments. Critical to the success of the method is the feature set used, which consists of a set of appropriately selected frequency-domain parameters, extracted both from the raw signal, as well as from the signal envelope, as a result of the engineering expertise, gained from the understanding of the physical behavior of defective rolling element bearings. Other advantages of the method are its ease of programming, simplicity and robustness. In order to overcome the sensitivity of the method to the choice of the initial cluster centers, the initial centers are selected using features extracted from simulated signals, resulting from a well established model for the dynamic behavior of defective rolling element bearings. Then, the method is implemented as a two-stage procedure. At the first step, the method decides whether a bearing fault exists or not. At the second step, the type of the defect (e.g. inner or outer race) is identified. The effectiveness of the method is tested in one literature established laboratory test case and in three different industrial test cases. Each test case includes successive measurements from bearings under different types of defects. In all cases, the method presents a 100% classification success. Contrarily, a K-means clustering approach, which is based on typical statistical time domain based features, presents an unstable classification behavior."

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, for computer vision in particular. In this approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation. Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power, neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking neurons’ transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many fewer operations and are the better candidates to process spatio-temporal data.}

	abstract = {Most experimental and theoretical studies of brain function assume that neurons transmit information as a rate code, but recent studies on the speed of visual processing impose temporal constraints that appear incompatible with such a coding scheme. Other coding schemes that use the pattern of spikes across a population a neurons may be much more efficient. For example, since strongly activated neurons tend to fire first, one can use the order of firing as a code. We argue that Rank Order Coding is not only very efficient, but also easy to implement in biological hardware: neurons can be made sensitive to the order of activation of their inputs by including a feed-forward shunting inhibition mechanism that progressively desensitizes the neuronal population during a wave of afferent activity. In such a case, maximum activation will only be produced when the afferent inputs are activated in the order of their synaptic weights.}

The effect of inhibitory inputs on the model behaviour is also taken into account. Here, inputs exclusively take the form of diffusion approximation and correlated inputs mean correlated synaptic inputs (2 The integrate-and-fire model and the Hodgkin–Huxley model, 3 Synaptic inputs). It is found that the IF and HH models respond to correlated inputs in totally opposite ways, but the IF-FHN model shows similar behaviour to the HH model. Increasing inhibitory input to single neuronal models, such as the FHN model and the HH model can sometimes increase their firing rates, which we termed inhibition-boosted firing (IBF). Using the IF model and the IF-FHN model, we theoretically explore how and when IBF can happen. The computational complexity of the IF-FHN model is very similar to the conventional IF model, but the former captures some interesting and essential features of biophysical models and could serve as a better model for spiking neuron computation.}

	abstract = {Can we express biophysical neuronal models as integrate-and-fire (IF) models with leakage coefficients which are no longer constant, as in the conventional leaky IF model, but functions of membrane potential and other biophysical variables? We illustrate the answer to this question using the FitzHugh–Nagumo (FHN) model as an example. A novel IF type model, the IF-FHN model, which approximates to the FHN model, is obtained. The leakage coefficient derived in the IF-FHN model has nonmonotonic relationship with membrane potential, revealing at least in part the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the FHN models. The IF-FHN model correspondingly exhibits more complex behaviour than the standard IF model. For example, in some parameter regions, the IF-FHN model has a coefficient of variation of the output interspike interval which is independent of the number of inhibitory inputs, being close to unity over the whole range, comparable to the FHN model as we noted previously (Brown et al., 1999).}
