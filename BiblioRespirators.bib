	abstract = "{Nine commonly used resuscitator bags were connected to an oxygen source, and tested by manually squeezing an 800-cc tidal volume ten times per minute into a test apparatus which measured the oxygen concentration delivered (up to 15 liters of oxygen per minute flowing). They were then tested on conscious volunteers. The Ambu gave the highest oxygen concentration (87\\% maximum) and the Pulmonator, the lowest (37\\% maximum). The Ambu with the new E-2 valve was found to be superior in function to the Ambu (with the Ruben valve) and the Ambu (Air Shields). The most common malfunction was sticking of the inflating valve in the inspiratory position. This was found with the Laerdal, Pulmonator, and Ambu (Ruben valve). The Ambu (with E-2 valve) was the easiest to use; the Pulmonator, Aga, and Laerdal (with reservoir), the most clumsy.}",

	abstract = {We propose a new point of view on weak solutions of the Euler equations, describing the motion of an ideal incompressible fluid in ${\Bbb R}^{n}$ with n ≥ 2. We give a reformulation of the Euler equations as a differential inclusion, and in this way we obtain transparent proofs of several celebrated results of V. Scheffer and A. Shnirelman concerning the non-uniqueness of weak solutions and the existence of energy-decreasing solutions. Our results are stronger because they work in any dimension and yield bounded velocity and pressure.},
